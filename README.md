# PersonalDataBot
This is a Personal Data chatbot developed by me using openai api_key. You need to have the secret_key i.e., api_key from openai and use it in the code in place of api_key in order to run it. Also make sure to fulfill all requirements specified in requirements.txt file. This bot answers any relevant questions you ask it by reading the data file contents. If something is asked which is out of context and not in the file, it says so and intimates to ask relevant questions only. It uses the GPT 3.5 Turbo model in the backend and streamlit for final execution and deployment.
